## Overview

Project idea gen was originally a place where myou could get an Idea for a think to make. Now I feel like I added somethinge here and something and it has grown into something that I could ahve never imagined. You can now get a random idea, search and filter between idea, submit your own idea, generate an idea  via ai, extend the idea to get first steps, and lastly I even added a voting system with a leaderboard. The best thing is I was able to make it look absoulutely amazing, I really like the css style, I would say the leaderboard page looks the best, but thats up to you.
